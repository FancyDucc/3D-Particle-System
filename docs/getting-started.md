## **Introduction**

Welcome to the official VortexFX documentation!
 
This system is designed to be able to give you just a bit more control over particles, and make them 3D at the same time! This system has features that go beyond normal 2D particles, the goal behind this system is to give you the freedom to create just about anything you can imagine.

If you’re aiming for effects like fireflies or lightning bolts or audio visualization, this system has you covered.

!!! danger "Notice"
    <div class="danger-header">VortexFX is in no way whatsoever meant to replace 2D particles, 2D particles are much more performance friendly and look better for circumstances that need it, 3D Particles are meant to add onto 2D particles or to be used as extra decoration.</div>

Videos are provided for almost all properties so you can determine the properties you need to get a perfect result before needing to download anything
Videos are NOT provided for super simple properties, like Rate or LifeTime

## **Key Features**

Here’s a quick rundown of what makes this particle system special:

### Realtime Collision Detection
This isn’t just for looks. Each particle can collide with the environment and respond in cool ways. Which can be useful for bouncy balls that bounce off walls or particles that react when they hit the ground.

---

### Trajectory Vertices
With this, you can make particles follow a path you define. If you need any shape from a straight line, to a circle, all the way to a rhombicosidodecahedron. This makes it super easy to control where your particles go without fully worrying about adjusting where your particles go with properties only.

---

### 3D Light Influence
Lighting can make or break an effect, and with this system, your particles can be influenced by the lights. Such as glowing embers that dim as they move away from a light source. These little touches can make a big difference in how your game feels.

!!! warning "Light influence is still in development"

    You may or may not come across flickers, bad shadow casting, or more, there are plenty of possible bugs that can happen with light influence, most of the bugs only happen with Shadows, so if you don't mind losing a bit of detail, maybe turn off those extra shadows that won't cause a problem.

---

### Instability
Instability allows particles to adjust their position slightly from where they originally are, this feature paired with trails is exceptional for lightning or electricity effects.
