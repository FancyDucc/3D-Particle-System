# Free Templates

To help you get started quickly, the system has a collection of pre-made templates that showcase the versatility of the **3D Particle Emitter**. Each template is designed to be easily customizable, so you can change them to fit your needs.

## **How to Use**

Each template is an `.rbxm` file. Simply download the file and drop it into the viewport in your Roblox experience. From there, you can use the template in your experience to do all sorts of things.

Don't expect lots of these, most of these templates are made simply from me using the system.
