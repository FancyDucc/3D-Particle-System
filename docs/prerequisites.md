# Prerequisites

The **3D Particle Emitter** module is designed to work  with the **ObjectCache** module, which helps optimize the reuse of parts for better performance. The good news is you don’t need to worry about setting it up separately, it comes preinstalled with the **3D Particle Emitter** system.

The **ObjectCache** module is already included with the **3D Particle Emitter** module, so there's no need for additional downloads or installations. It’s integrated and ready to use as soon as you set up the **3D Particle Emitter**.

## **Download the ObjectCache Module (Optional)**

If you’re interested in using **ObjectCache** separately for other projects or want to explore its functionality on its own, you can see it here:
